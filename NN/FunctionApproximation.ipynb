    "_This example was originally written for the Practical Machine Learning Summer School developed by Adrian Bevan (a.j.bevan@qmul.ac.uk) for Queen Mary University of London (C) 2018 and has been modified for the ATLAS UK Machine Learning Tutorial (Jan 2019)._\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example for using TensorFlow machine learning.  A single layer perceptron is used to learn the function $y = x^2$.  This jupyter notebook uses an L2 loss function and allows the user to specify some range $x \\in [min\\_x, max\\_x]$ for plotting.  Test and train samples of events will be created and the network will be trained and evaluated as a function of training epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose is to illustrate the application of a neural network to learning y=f(x) with a single dimensional input feature space resulting in a regression output for a single dimensional output feature space.  The network has a specified number of nodes, each uses a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function.  This activation function is given by \n",
    "\n",
    " $f = \\max(0, w x) + b$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w$ is the weight and $b$ the bias parameter.  The neural network configuration is set up with one input, 50 nodes and one output, culminating in 50 weights and 50 biases for the input feature feeding into the layer of nodes, and 50+1 parameters feeding into the output node.  i.e. a total of 151 weight parameters needs to be optimised in order to learn this problem.  The network configuration is illustrated below:\n",

    "We will use three Python libraries for this example: numpy, tensorflow and matplotlib.  In addition to the network weights (also known as model hyperparmeters) we have the following hyperparameters related to the optimisation of the network:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __learning_rate__ - this is the step size for the gradient descent optimisation process that is used (we will use the ADAM optimiser for this example).  The smaller the step size the longer it will take for the optimisation process to converge. The larger the step size the quicker to converge - up to a point.  The gradient descent algorothm is derived assuming that the step size is sufficiently small so as to guarantee a reduction inthe rate.  Try changing this parameter by a factor of 10 or more in either direction (so down to 0.001 and up to 0.1) to see what happens.\n",
    " * __training_epochs__ - this is the number of gradient descent optimisation steps taken.  \n",
    " \n",
    " Other parameter related to the problem include the range parameters (noted above) initially set to $[min\\_x, max\\_x] = [-10, 10]$ and Ngen, the number of training examples to generate.\n",
